# SystemAnalysis

Who was the client?
  The client for this project was DriverPass.
  
What type of system did they want designed?
  DriverPass wanted a system designed to help future drivers train for their drivers' test.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I believe I did a good job on breaking down the project in the UML diagrams.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  Of the two documents included I am not sure if I personally could improve on them much on my own but if I had to choose one perhaps I would chose the system design document     as I feel I may have rushed a little on it.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpreted the user's needs by seeing what needed to be implemented into the sytem and all the readings up to the end of the project (also a little bit of creativity of my   own). It is important to consider the user's needs when designing such a project because without pleasing the users the project will be meaningless.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  The best approach I have found for designing software is to break it down into sections and just work section to section and use methods such as psuedocode and UML diagrams     to help me work on the project effectively and "see" the project in another way.
